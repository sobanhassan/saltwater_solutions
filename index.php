            <p> My wife and I started our first 55 gal Fowler saltwater tank with a hang-on-the-back protein skimmer in 1998. We had a yellow tang and a porcupine puffer that would eat out of our hands. 
            We loved our little fish tank, but eventually life happened.</p> <br>
            <p>Fast forward 20 years and several YouTube videos later, and weâ€™re the proud owners of a used coralline encrusted 90 gal tank. 
            In order to save money I built the stand, acrylic sump, and acrylic ATO reservoir myself. Working with acrylic on my own tank eventually led me to build and sell my first acrylic frag tank along with other aquarium 
            equipment including the Nori Nibbler.</p><br>
            <p>The development of the Nori Nibbler started from simply wanting to feed my fish nori without the mess. It began with a piece of plastic tube, some zip ties and plastic mesh. After many hours, a few failures, and contacting dozens of suppliers we had the solution; the Nori Nibbler! The BEST way to feed nori without the mess.</p> <br>
            <p>Our goal at Saltwater Solutions LLC is to provide high quality products that are developed and manufactured in the U.S.A., to help solve the problems that plague saltwater hobbyists.
